# UFOs

## Overview

 

In this module we utilized our newly developed JavaScript skills to create an interactive website that shows UFO sightings around the world. This interactive website pulls data into a filterable table that has all the recorded UFO sightings. To create this website, we created four separate files. A JavaScript file that contains the data of sightings, another JavaScript file that holds functions to pull the data into the table and build it and a function to filter the table. The last two files we built were an html file to build the body and content of the website and a css file to style the webpage and pull in images. The html file builds the body of the website and reads in the JavaScript files and css files to display the page. The webpage has built in filters that are displayed on the left side of the screen and allow you to search by date, city, state, country, and shape. The function we build in JavaScript app first will pull the data into the file from the data.js file and the second function will use a loop to go through the objects and pull the criteria that was inputted into the search bar on the webpage.

 

## Summary

 

The webpage is filled with a lot of data, and it would be extremely cumbersome to have to scroll and look through all of it to find a specific piece of information you are looking for, so we created search and filter boxes. On the left side of the page, there are several different search criteria, if you wanted to find a specific date, you could plug in a date for example 1-4-2010 and see all of the sighting information from that date.

You could further that search criteria by searching in a specific state or country from that date to show everything that happened on 1-4-2010 in Virginia. These search bars are extremely helpful if you want to pinpoint a certain piece of information.

One draw back to this would be that you would have to know what criteria to search for within the data. If you are looking for a specific city of sightings there might not be any information within the data on that city. If there were a drop down that contains cities/states/countries could be helpful to the user to be able to see the specific locations within the data set and chose a location. Another improvement to the site would be to include a duration search bar with a drop down. That is the only other piece of information in the table that is not included in the search criteria. CHECK THIS FIRST OR being able to use multiple search criteria at once.
